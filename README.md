# Big Genomics Data Skills Training for Professors 
### [The Jackson Laboratory](http://www.jax.org)

From 2016 to 2018, a 5-day training program has been developed in the [Jackson laboratory](http://www.jax.org). The purpose of the course is to offer training to professors from small colleges, regional universities, HBCU and INBRE institutions in big data-computational biology. The goal of the program is to enable professors to launch Big Data or Computational Biology courses at their home institutions. Professors will be trained, receive a curricular model and be offered the ongoing technical support required to teach undergraduate courses in Biomedical Big Data science. This program is funded by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative.

The training program included seminars, extensive hands-on data analyses, evening activities and collaborative curriculum development work. Instruction covered data analysis of RNA-Seq, Exome-Seq, Whole Genome and ChiP-Seq data types. Hands on data analysis was done in Galaxy and terminal.

In the past three years, our short-course has been proven to be a desirable program. We have developed adaptable bioinformatics modules to be implemented appropriately into an undergraduate curriculum. To benefit broader audience, we decide to release our lastest couse materials here. We hope that our sharing with the community will inform colleagues, encourage collaborations and discussions, and most beneficially inspire new approaches to enhance bioinformatics education for our field. 

**NOTE**: The truncated sequence data can be accessed at [ftp://ftp.jax.org/encode](ftp://ftp.jax.org/encode). Included in ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq modules have scripts for truncating single-end and pair-end sequencing data.
