## Cancer Variant Module

### Objective

In this module, DNA mutation and sequence analysis are introduced. An excercise is appended on how to identify the driver mutation from three tumors of the same type.

### Data background

Melanoma tumors: ME050, ME100L, ME024

Literaure: Michael F. Berger *et al* Nature 2012 [doi:10.1038/nature11071](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11071)

### Data analysis

The data file is provded in both .xls and .txt format. The analysis will be performed in R. Steps are described in the lecure slides ('Chuang mutation calling'). We recommend you to install the current version of R but it is not critical for this excercise. (You may download R from [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org))
